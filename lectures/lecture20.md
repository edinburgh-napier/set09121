# Bug Catching

[**Game Developer Article - My Hardest Bug Ever**](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/my-hardest-bug-ever)

The symptom was that you'd go to save your progress and it would access the memory card, and almost all the time, it worked normally

... But every once in a while the write or read would time out

... for no obvious reason. A short write would often corrupt the memory card. 

The player would go to save, and not only would we not save, we'd wipe their memory card.

# Playtesting

Playtests can be super useful. If you treat them right.

1. Be clear of your test goals <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - are you testing if a single mechanic works?
 - are you testing to see if a level is the right difficulty?
 - are you testing to get a general review?
2. Make a correct environment for your test. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Turn off features or levels with issues to isolate just the feature you want to test 
3. Pick your test candidates, and make sure to inform them accordingly <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
4. Be aware of what you do/don't tell test participants beforehand <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
5. RECORD THE TEST (Screen capture) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
6. Don't hover <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
7. Do a post-test survey / interview. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

1. What was your favorite moment or interaction? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. What was your least favorite moment or interaction? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. When did you feel the most clever? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Was there anything you wanted to do that the game wouldn't let you do? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. If you had a magic wand and could change any aspect of the game or your experience, what would it be? Unlimited budget and time. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Technical Requirement Checklist (TRC)


---

# TRC Intro

- This has many different names, but all companies have them
- It's vital if you release anything for consoles, in particular
- It's all about ensuring that your game works on the hardware
- Sometimes it is just to ensure everything behaves in a standard, expected, way.

---

# TRC Example 1

When save data is loaded, the state of the application at
the save timing (including game progress, status of characters and their
owned items, play history, etc.) is restored correctly.


---

# TRC Examples 2 

If the time required for loading exceeds 30 seconds, the
application displays an animation. Progress information such as a
progress bar or the remaining time is displayed if the time required for
loading exceeds 60 seconds.


---

# TRC Examples 3

Test all online activity with a 2000 friend account

---

# Your TRC Pt.1

- 2D graphics engine using SFML
- Main menu (Ability to quit to menu, and restart game)
- Some form of AI
- Interactive Sound (i.e not just background music)
- 1080p/60fps on a reasonable systems specification
- Usability options:
 - Remappable controls
 - Controller support
- Graphics options (Resolution & window mode)
- Windows: 10 x64
- Single file .exe game installer/uninstaller
- User preference/savegame saving/loading from disk
- Web presence with game promo material and downloads

---

# Your TRC Pt.2 

- Software Design & Code Quality
    - Tidy, documented, and organised code.
    - Use of appropriate software patterns.
    - Evidence of performance analysis and optimisation.
- Software Engineering Methods & Testing
    - Evidence of proper version control best practises
    - Evidence of proper project management
    - Working continuous integration
    - Working build testing
    - Evidence and reports from playtests


---

# Accessibility 
<http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com>

- Allow the game to be started without the need to navigate through multiple levels of menus
- Ensure no essential information is conveyed by a colour alone
- Ensure no essential information is conveyed by sounds alone
- Offer a wide choice of difficulty levels or difficulty customisation
- Give a clear indication that interactive elements are interactive
- Allow interfaces to be resized
- Allow all narrative and instructions to be replayed

---

# Localisation 

Watch out for:
- EFIGS!
- Vertical text!
- Text in Art Assets!
- Gendered Languages
- Player chat & Unicode



---

## Publishing


---

# Role of Publishers Then:

- Bankroll Development
- Handle All Marketing
- Negotiate Physical Sales and distribution
- Localisation and QA
- Legal Protection
- Occasionally hotdrop producers into dev team

---

# Role of Publishers Now:
- *Might* pay you something before game is finished
- Handle some marketing, devs do *"Community Management"*
- Negotiate *some* sales deals (particularly with platform holders)
- **Localisation and QA**
- **Legal Protection**
- Having said that, every publisher is different. Get the deal that works for you!

---

# Legals

I'm not a lawyer, and neither are you.

- Get a lawyer
- Form a company
- Protect your IP
- Don't get sued

[LINK: IGDA white papers on IP](https://igda.org/resources/) 

If you game can be cloned. It will be cloned.


---

# Legal costs

- **Form a company** 
    - Protects *you* if you are sued (Actually pretty easy in the UK) £100-1000
- **Contracts** 
    - Formal agreement on ownership of work. Get one even if someone is doing work for free. £600-1000
- **Trademark your game and company** 
    - People can still clone your game, but they can't pretend to be you  £500-2000
- **Terms of Service and Privacy Policy** 
    - Stop you being sued in the first place £600-1000
- **Package deals** 
    - Common for Indies £3000

Disclaimer: costs found after 20 mins of googling + I'm not a lawyer.

# Review

- Keep enough time for QA
- Consider Localisation & Accessibility
- TRC == MARKS
- Game publishing is a legal battleground
- If you plan on selling your game... Good luck
