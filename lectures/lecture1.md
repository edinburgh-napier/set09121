# What is Games Engineering
![Wikipedia for Engineering](assets/images/engineering.png)


* Engineering is design, building and use of engines. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Games Engineering is the application of this to video games - we are going to design, build and use an engine to make a game. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Many technical members of a games development team are called engineers. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* We are using the same analogies that are applied to software engineers. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* This module will focus on the development of a game engine <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Entity management, physics system, AI, other management functionality. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

# Module Aims


* Gain experience in games development, particularly the technical aspects of games development. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


* Examine the technical aspects of games and break these down to understand how games work. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


* Put together a basic game engine for 2D games. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


* Examine some of the fundamental technologies used in games development, such as artificial intelligence and physics. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# Why Not Just Use Unity/Unreal?


* Because some people need to make Unity/Unreal! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* A lot of studios have in-house game engines: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    * Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) 
    * Wube Software - custom game engine for Factorio 
    * UbiArt - Ubisoft Montpellier 
    * No Man's Skye Engine - Hello Game 
    * [https://github.com/raysan5/custom_game_engines](https://github.com/raysan5/custom_game_engines) 
* Understanding how game engines works will make you a better game engineer <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* It will help you even if you use a pre-made engine <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Teaching and Assessment


---

# Structure – Lectures

* Two one-hour lectures a week.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    * Monday 2pm-4pm in A17
* Lectures will cover:  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    * Game design concepts. 
    * Software engineering for games.  
    * Game technology.
    * How our game engine works.


---

# Structure – Practical Sessions

- Two-hour practical session. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Monday 4pm-6pm in JKCC clusters 6 to 10 (5 if there is not enough desks)
- Practicals take place in JKCC. Bring your laptop or use the lab PCs. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Labs will help you develop the engine you need to use for the coursework. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - 2D development with SFML.
    - Physics with Box2D.
    - Management infrastructure for the engine.
- You need to do these practicals and keep up – they form the basis of the coursework submission. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


---

# Coursework

- Develop a game using the game engine.
    - **You cannot use one of our samples and just change the graphics**, or likewise with samples for SFML, Box2D, etc. – this will be a **FAIL**!

- You will work with two partners, think who you might want to work with.

- Coursework has four submissions.
    - [Week ~7:] Game design document.
    - [Week ~13:] Implementation and report.
    - [Week ~13:] Demo and peer assessment.

# Work Plan

- You __**WILL**__ have to work around 14 hours per week on the module.
    - 4 hours of contact (lectures and practicals).
    - 10 hours of self-study.
- The coursework requires working in groups which will require some organisation outside class time.
    - Use Discord/Slack/Whatsapp to communicate (make sure you book regular meetings).
- Keep up with the practical work!  There is one every week.
    - The practicals build the engine you need.  Falling behind one week means trying to catch up the next!

## Module Outline


---

# Focus of the Module

- **Game design:** Initially we will focus on basic design ideas and show how we can use these to engineer our game.
- **Software modelling:** Applying common modelling techniques to games development.
- **Game mechanics:** Developing the underlying rules and procedure for our game (AI, physics, etc.).
- **Software development:** Programming our design, model, and mechanics to produce a working game.
- **Playing games:** Yes, you will have to play games.  However, you will start to analyse games more closely and understand more about what is happening within them.


---

# Not the Focus of the Module

- **Introduction to C++ programming:** If you do not have experience with C++ then get a book to learn the basics quickly.  We will cover some concepts, but not the basics.
- **Object-orientation:** We will refresh the basics in the context of C++ and games development, but if you require more knowledge then you are recommended to get a book.  You will likely learn more about object-orientation in this module by doing the work provided.
- **Graphics and sound creation:**  You are not expected to create your own graphics. A lot free assets exist on internet. Sound integration and design will not be covered in this module.


---

# Useful Websites

- **SFML:** https://www.sfml-dev.org

     SFML provides our graphics system for our game engine.  You will need to use this resource when working with SFML.

- **Box2D:** http://box2d.org

     Box2D provides the physics system for our game engine.  Again, you will need to use this resource when working with Box2D.

- **C++:** http://www.learncpp.com

     Modern C++ tutorials. Unofficial reference at http://www.cppreference.com

- **Game Programming Patterns:** http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com

     Want to know more about the patterns we use and other patterns useful for games?  This website provides a number of examples.

# Contacting the Module Team

### Contact details:


Leni Le Goff: **l.legoff2@napier.ac.uk**


- The best time to ask for help is during the practical sessions.
- Ideally, try and complete the practical before the class and then ask questions during the lab time.
- At least, you have to finish the lab during the week following the practical.
- In other words: make sure you work on this outside the assigned time!


---

# And finally...
		
- I hope you have fun during the module.
- The module has been designed to be challenging but with effort everyone can succeed.
- We hope you will learn:
    - How games work and how you can put them together.
    - How to do software engineering properly (from our point of view!)
